                        When trying to solve problems, I like to look at them from various perspectives. <br>
                        <span>Some people criticize this as being inefficient,</span> and indeed, in terms of producing results quickly, this way of solving problems is of course inefficient. <br> 
                        Sometimes my approach takes a lot of time, and this can have drawbacks at times. <br> 
                        However, I believe this approach has a creative component, especially in the academic perspective.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Above all, to think from various perspectives is, for me, more interesting and enjoyable. <br> 
                        When trying to truly understand a problem or a question, I believe tackling that question from many angles is the best way. <br> 
                        <em>This perspective has helped me to develop my academic creativity, and has also firmly established my background in computational algorithms. </em> <br>
